# quadratic_eqn_solver

A Flutter Quadratic Equation Solver.

## Getting Started
App Bar: this is the topmost field that displays the name of the program/app.
Home page: this is the main screen of the program where all interaction with user takes place.
Textboxes: three (3) of these will be used to take numerical input from.
Execute Button: this is a clickable button that enables user to compute input data using the quadratic formula so that the result can be displayed on the result card.
Clear Button: this is to clear/reset data from all textboxes and results.
Result Card: this is where the result/output of the computed data is displayed to the user.
User Guide: this box displays about quadratic equations and the parameters ‘a’, ‘b’, & ‘c’ needed to solve the quadratic equation.
